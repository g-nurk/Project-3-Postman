My third project at Cerebrum Hub was: “CRM” which was “Customer Relationship Management Platform”. Our customer was a digital agency Elevate Digital, which offers innovative marketing and web design solutions. Because of the number of different projects that they're working on and also the high number of customers, the company is using a CRM or customer relationship management software to organize their marketing and sales processes.

There are three main business processes that are supported: CRM is used to collect all potential customers that come from different marketing channels and ensure that those customers are receiving proper communication or marketing activities; If customers have specific needs and are interested to move forward with this digital agency, there is a process of negotiating terms, preparing offers, and finally signing a contract - the process of closing sales; The third business process that CRM is supporting is the management of the projects that are already solved.

The main objective - to ensure that all our projects are on track, that things are done by the deadline, that they received the money on time, etc.

Our project goals were to build a stable and well-tested API for all key functionalities (leads management, invitation of new users, funnels management, deals management); Cover the Deals API and Notes API by test cases and perform testing; Cover the CRM by End-To-End test cases and perform testing.

In this project we made a Postman collection for API testing. My mission was to make team workspace in Postman and test funnels API (in addition, any bugs found were reported in Jira, for example: if we can test something without authorization token then it was reported as a bug). Out of 55 bug reports from my team, I did 37. In addition, I also wrote test cases for Notes API and End-to-End test cases in Confluence.

Since I was the only one in this team who had experience of being a sprint coordinator then throughout the whole project I acted as a co-coordinator, which meant that I got to be the coordinator in three different teams and talk through assignments and helping them and fixing mistakes which made me learn better and also gave me the confidence to stand out as a leader who makes her voice heard and gets everything necessary done by the deadline.

End-To-End test cases I also did in the Confluence.

Our team was victorious, leading to 100% result in project 3, both individually and team-based.

My Manual Testing Graduation Exam also resulted in 100%.
